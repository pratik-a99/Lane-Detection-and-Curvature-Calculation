# ENPM673 Project 2

## Libraries Used:
* Numpy
* OpenCV (cv)

## Instructions to run the code

### Problem 1
1. The input images should be present in a folder named `adaptive_hist_data` in the same directory as the python file for `Problem_1.py`.  The names should be the same as they were on google drive.
2. Run the code using `python Problem_1.py` in an Ubuntu terminal. Press `q` to stop the code.

Note: Adaptive Histogram is slow hence each frame will take around ~2-3 sec to load.

### Problem 2
1. The input video should be present in the same directory as the python file for `Problem_2.py`.  The names should be the same as they were on google drive.
2. Run the code using `python Problem_2.py` in an Ubuntu terminal. Press `q` to stop the code.

### Problem 3
1. The input video should be present in the same directory as the python file for `Problem_3.py`.  The names should be the same as they were on google drive.
2. Run the code using `python Problem_3.py` in an Ubuntu terminal. Press `q` to stop the code.

All the required videos, images, and other files should be in the same folder and named as given in the code. All the files are included in the repository.

The code can also be run in any IDE such as PyCharm or Visual Studio Code
